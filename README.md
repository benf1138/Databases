I am planning to create a database cataloging the Star Wars movies and tv shows. My four entities at this point will be Movie Titles, Actors, Tv Show Titles, and Characters. 

It will look something like this:
Movie - Episode IV – A New Hope, Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back, Episode VI – Return of the Jedi, Episode I – The Phantom Menace: They could be described as title, release number, or release year
TV - The Clone Wars, Rebels, The Bad Batch, The Mandalorian: These could be described as show name, release year, or timeline in the Star Wars universe
Actors - Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Natalie Portman: Actors could be described as their character, and which title they are associated with
Characters - Anakin Skywalker, Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Han Solo: The characters could be described as which title they were in, and who plays them. 

Here is a list of questions for database uses: 
Did a certain actor play a role across multiple titles. 
Did any characters appear in multiple titles. 
What year was a title released compared to its place in the chronological order of the story.
